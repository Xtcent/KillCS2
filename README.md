# Kill cs2.exe
I wrote a batch script to kill your Counter-strike 2 process by pressing a set key on your keyboard. <br />
The default key is numpad9, but you can set it to any key you want. <br />
The script sends a simple **"taskkill /IM cs2.exe /F"** command to your task manager. <br />
This becomes neccesseray because you are sometimes unable to access the task manager to close the game when it freezes. <br />

# Usage
1. Download the batch script <br />
2. Run it <br />
3. Press Numpad 9 to close the game when neccesary. <br />
